    <div>
      <h4>The background server has marked this url as unsafe to browse!</h4>
	  <p>Attention: You have navigated to a website that our database has flagged as 
		potentially unsafe.   <br> 
		Similar to entering a poorly lit alley known for troubles,   <br> 
		browsing on an unsafe website can expose you to several online threats.   <br> 
		These may include harmful viruses, malicious software, or deceptive phishing  <br> 
		traps that attempt to trick you into sharing private information such as   <br> 
		passwords or credit card details.</p>
	  <p>Just as you would avoid a suspicious alley, it's crucial to steer clear   <br> 
		from unsafe websites to safeguard your personal data and maintain the health   <br> 
		of your device. Remember, if you find yourself in an unfamiliar  <br> 
		digital environment, it's better to retreat. Navigate away from the website   <br> 
		immediately and do not click on  any links, download files, or   <br> 
		provide any personal information.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the internet, always trust your instincts and prioritize   <br> 
		safety. If a website doesn't seem  trustworthy or secure, it's always best   <br> 
		to leave and ask for help from a trusted source if needed. Always remember:   <br> 
		"This is an unsafe website. Proceed with caution or, better yet, not at all."</p>
